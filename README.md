# pyromania

Pyromania is a Python library for machine learning and predictive statistical modeling that provides Pythonic and scikit-learn-like interfaces for many packages from the R programming language ecosystem.

For a long time, [RPy2](https://rpy2.github.io/doc/v2.9.x/html/index.html) has allowed Python programmers to use R packages in their preferred programming language. As RPy2 is a relatively low-level library, however, using R packages in Python has never been easy enough for it to be a viable option for most users. Pyromania aims to give Python programmers access to R's great ecosystem of packages by providing familiar interfaces to these packages, with a particular focus on providing access to models that currently do not have satisfactory implementations in Python.
